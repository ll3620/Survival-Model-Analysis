# Survival-Model-Analysis

This repository contains the coursework completed for the 'Survival Model Analysis' module under the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London.

This is not an exhaustively analysis because there is a page limited set in this coursework, here is a an outline of this analysis:

##### Part One. 
Base on the dataset cwdata.csv,
1. Fitted an exponential distribution to this data and reported the estimated parameter.
2. Fitted a Weibull distribution to the data and reported the estimated parameter.
3. Plotted the survivor functions of both fitted distribution and a Kaplan-Meier estimate.
4. Investigated the cumulative hazard function of fitted distrbution alongside with Nelson-Aalan Estimator. Commented on the appropriateness of the model.

##### Part Two.
Picked a time-to-event data set from survival package in R, used 5 covariates to,
1. Explaint the dataset
2. Fitted a parametric and semi-parametric survival model to the data.
3. Plotted survival curves from one of the regression methods for 3-4 covariates, and illustrated the effect, included a Kaplan-Meier estimate.
